# multi_header_injector
Multi Header Injector is a Burp Suite extension (Jython) that lets you inject and auto-refresh custom authentication headers across Burp tools like Scanner, Proxy, and Intruder. It’s built for authenticated scans where Burp’s built-in login or session handling fails. For example:- When 2FA or short-lived tokens are used.
